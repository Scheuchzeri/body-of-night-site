        <p class="verse">It is only in the park of this city,
          I will be able to meet you.

          Here it will be as if 
          we shook hands, actually
          touched.

          My body standing, erect
          your body before mine. 

          Our names written on each others' lips.



          Somewhere:



          The smile of a child,
          violently turned into blood
          by airraids.

          Not just an image removed,
          the body of night is devastated
          by searchlights.

          Even as each drop pummels
          the pavement, the rain
          and the -

          Go!

          Outside!

          And shake somebody's hand!
          Anybody's.





          I believe in the corporeal, so
          keep it up and the change!

          I have said this before:

          there
          is
          no
          right
          time.

          Water the plants in September since
          anybody might not be anybody at all!





          It is a sudden language,
          to be heard only when you speak it.
          
          Like cats playing
          on the brink of a rain
          drain - in the dead of night -

          waking you up. Then,
          a respite.

          As if storms were coming.



          I dream you up

          sitting by a brook somewhere, immediately
          flooded! and

                   and

          and Langston Hughes loves the rain!





          Leave me now.
          I have done all I could.

          There seems to be something,
          within each one of us, which
          must never be touched.

          I have done it.
          I have done
          all I could.

          And even though I have tried

          and

          tried, and even though
          we've met in my head so many times -
          it's always the same

          memory, afterwards.
          I could make up different ways
          for loving you.

          I could make up,
          make out,

          make - do anything!
          For loving you.

          Rays of sunlight, made up out of
          milky ways, travelling throughout yolksacks
          bursting the membrane,
          grasshoppers,
                       making their way across

          a greenleaf suspended in midair,
                                          laid
          low above the wind -
          with or without faces even!

          Or tracing our lips, that is
          by smiling,
          hanging upright in the air!

          Holding hands, barefooted, all ways,
          as long as we walk them together,

          I could make up
          for love of
          dreaming
          you I could
          be, and
          in the dark,
          between us

          there is something.





          It would all come back in an instant,
          I am sure of it:
          Asphalt and
          misty rain and
          chlor! something like washing powder and

          the smell!
          the smell!

          for the life of me I cannot remember
          the smell!

          I can remember a hectic
          bustling about and the sunshine, a heat -
          another lifetime...

          And so I keep on writing.
          I write against that which


          "cradled sprouts from the ground / made sunlight".




          Let us get up and greet the morning,
          all in blue,
          uniform -

          Can we trust its patrol?
          Even if we cannot understand each other?





          The night is coming on swiftly like your favorite song.
          Tenderly you know me, and
          of course I'm scared because of it!

          I gently rock you to sleep, your body
          pressed against mine.

          The dreams, the longing, the wishing, all
          this? Could this really be it?

          Following strange peoples,
          in strange suits,
          observing strange rituals,
          early in the morning.



          I can remember a bus-stop.



          I was sure, at that time,
          that nothing would ever defeat me.

          I felt
          confirmed
          in life's unharnished anxiety for -

          now

          I wonder...

          now

          I miss the rhythmic heat,
          my eyes are tired,

          now

          I wonder...

          What is essential?





          Sleep as an antidote against fleeting life.





          It felt like reaching
          attaining what I had desired.
          Experiencing in dumb incredulity
          the first breasts

          not being my mother's

          of a woman I loved -




          I remember.




          The question of day, evaded night -
          I have to face it instead:


          Which I once loved, where
          is that place now?


          A mouthcushion, the early morning

          sunlight lying scattered by the windowpane;
          not unlike a dry twig

          that breaks with a snap -


          Could I grasp it within my fingertips?



          Soft blue thoughts
          before these pastel walls,


          you eat me up as tenderly
          comes on the summer dawn, one
          dreaming, I

                   yawn

                         yawn

                               yawn


          Y       A        W         N


          A wide void throughout which
          these words keep chasing you.



          As the birds have,
          I sung your parting.

          You are long long gone.

          Stealing past my curtains,
          twilight
          is an opening like flesh.

          Where night's rough fingers touch
          day fades between your legs.

          Then you put them in my mouth,
          me, Suneater,
          full of greed

          like a puppy


                "blau"

                "blau"

                "blau"

          devouring every hour,
          a feast insatiable, until

          above the rooftops flicker
          discounted stars, and 
          the display flickers as the battery dies.





          The moon, an advertisement
          above the shopping mall,
          a hidden sequence:

          11110000000000000101110100001010101111110

          10000010101000000000000001010101000010101

          11100101010000001010111111111111101110101

          00000000000010111011111111111100010100010

          like an image digitalized:


          YOU ARE MY 1-AND-0-NLY !

          



          Bless me with a smile
          because I deserve it.

          You are just a memory to me now.
          A photo of a photo.


          And how many memories there are in the sky,
          "memories of a large memory".




          We are ellipsing each other.




          I'm not sure why.
          This dream I had had
          of the birds and the
          rain -


          The sound of my all my poetry this morning...


          The long wait unwound, and just
          as I was stretching out my arm -
          the alarm clock.



          

          At that point, of course, 
          no one would take new perspectives. 
          And I would have proven - 
          although with finality no one can say - 

          out of my mind! 

          There is the possibility
          that I am lost for words. 





          Visible, yet far out of reach, 
          dancing above you like a snowflake. 

          Its idea of caring, 
          embracing everything
          at once. 



          The darkness is scared of them
          for they hold destructive potentials


          dreams


          within my pillow, unaired
          that gather and then fester
          like feathers still bloody from plucking. 

          Come
          and gone. 

          Just
          like
          that. 





          May your dreams be weird and smell!
          Good night. Sleep well. 
          Don't ask why!
          Fly across the milky sky!
          As day has made its stretched out kite. 
          Sleep save and
          good night. 

          The rest is mist. 
          Anything, 
          really. 

          Space
          to be filled out later. 



          Lo! 
          The morning!
          It has arriven!



          I must get up, I suppose. 
          But I can't help thinking:
          what if? 


          The sky is grey. 
          Will it rain today? 


          I remember: nights
          when lightning strikes!
          Frustrating the end of - 


          We need to talk about you. 
          It's in our nature. 

          How you move through the streets.
          How you take up 
          space and claim power. 

          Just like

          because of this yellow cone of light
          on my nightstand
          dust becomes visible
          for a moment
          and
          a certain

          perimeter. 


          What might be said
          to exist only in my head - 

          like a cloud - 



          impassive night outside my window



          becomes snowflake, that is to say,
          in between, 
          for but a moment only

          (throughout which it falls) 

          it then becomes ground. 


          Just like the rain used to. 





          Memory, the blackened street - 
          the wind shifts, and like a leaf,

          carries this plane behind class 
          like a message in a bottle

          gleaming like seafoam - (or are we merely dreaming?):

          To hold me as you hold me
          near is only the thought of someone. 

          Instead wavelengths across space, and searching
          I listen in:



          "...gleiche Weg ist nicht immer derselbe..."
          "...même si vous le parcouriez encors !"
          "...what's keeping me awake is what I lost..."


          Then some bad harmonizing. 

          I'd like to write a song, and - 





          Silver, soft and silken, 
          allow me to clothe you in words. 
          That others may fathom you. 

          We are so naïve! 
          Trusting our eyes!

          An empty space to be filled out?
          I am a pull and a traction - I am. 


          What is it to you? 


          The hair close to the drain
          whirling like clouds


          in the sky, and this wonder 
          at anything scarlett!

          Longing: it won't be quite the same, 
          regardless. The thin

          air, just before the rain 
          drops -

          made out of I guess


          it's been too long since I've seen a sunset. 


          Of how you are in the world, 
          of that we need to speak. 

          The diseases you carry, 
          your edges and shapes, 
          indiscriminately
          talk about

          anything, really. 


          This desire for life - 

          spring!

          Perfect elongation into 

          spring!

          Soles of feet that

          spring!

          Into the mellow night, the soft
          night, may once more spring

          butts! 

          and

          painful

          disillusion! and the 
          futility of it all!

          but also
          butts!
          and

          sunshine and mayflowers!

          Those lightning apparitions
          frustrating repetition, and 
          obscenities! and
          sex! and

          shouting! Springing up and
          out of itself seeking
          relief from a winter cooped up - 

          spring!

          Mystery of things lying around aimlessly. 
          A hymn
          from within
          the deep



          where everything is glaring back at me, 
          why? 



          Every day is supposed to be a handful - 
          why? 

          And,
          how strange to trust my own voice
          again whispering anticipation, whispering. 

          Soft words inhaled on a melody. 

          I echo this song you sing. 


          What is life? 



          A condom ripping by chance. And
          this body
          of our chance encounter - 



          what infathomable frustration!



          I have been waiting so long!
          Enduring not eyesight
          that I may know you by feeling. Now

          let me rip them off you!


          All those words hiding your skin!


          Like the dawn is not a just fancy in some poet's mind,
          as water glazes
          on glass

          I long to feel the night on your wrists. 
          Instead
          silence where once roaring currents led
          chanting blood through your veins, 

          before the rain
          pounded pools of pavement, 
          there is no more inbetween 
          the interstices. 

          I long to ponder them! 
          I long to brush them casually
          as if by chance - skin
          touching skin. 


          a parched memory soacked in dust 

          just as clouds may appear

          there are to be thoughts



          your body is 
          touched. 

          Violently, intimately
          touched.

          Like a willow is touched by the storm. 

          
          How deep run your roots 
          planted by this body of water? 


          And then dusk. 
          Coming in the forms of leaves
          scattered all around the ground. 





          As you sleep through my fingers
          and into the obstinate night,
          wheat blossoms and dandelions grow 

          wafting before red sunsets

          like a flight of swallows. 


          Dip your fingers into regardless. 
          Make palm trees out of your hands, and 
          early in the morning

          as willows would their hair

          bath them in the even and cool
          black pool. 







          HERE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO STAND !!! 



          THE 



          "Heart-wrenching ballad 
          Of the Ebony Coffee Stain
          Left onto an Ivory Kitchen Table!"



          ALAS !!!



          I was careless. 
          And I wiped away without thinking. 
          Still sleepy 
          from a dream I had had
          awoken at the dead of night. 

          I got up only since I heard the kettle ding. 







          These thoughts, 
          allow me to journey them along your skin. 


          Since being means being 
          full of contradictions. 


          The city deserves a cure,
          a pen, a syringe. 


          It is out of my hands now. 
          You are the traces I leave in the air. 


          To say we were made out of dreams,
          is to say anything, really - 



          Whose dreams? 



          Sunday mornings we revolve around breakfeast,
          coffee drunk without reserve. 


          You can never straighten out
          paper folds. 

          You cannot throw this away
          without waste. 


          Tonight I feel like a virus, 
          a malignant body. 

          Greedily I inhabitate you
          being my host, strip you
          bare to grasp what lies beneath. 

          It's all just words, anyway. 

          Distractedly we even the interstices
          each morning by treading them without feet. 

          What does that make me? 

          Hungry to feel a pulse
          I search the night

          But for the body of this city,
          nobody else is present. 



          I illuminate my own darkness. 



          I do believe we are made of dreams. 



          We seem in any case to be - 

          what is quite impossible - 



          and on top of that, on a bridge,
          a bridge 
          spanning the blue night. 



          I do believe we meet here, you and me. 


          Between us, all these crumbled up 
          instances, not unlike folds in paper - 

          but sweet. 



          Should I, by chance,
          know the lines of you face, 
          that ironic miscalculation of fate,

          it shall be a brief communion;

          providing thought for a whole lifetime 
          cloaked in silence. 





          I am since you touch me.
          Pulling my insides out and over 
          your feet, 

          writing about it now,
          because it excites me, 
          I think about sex. 

          I would wear them sometimes
          when we made love, 
          that intricate act of self-annihilation,
          plain, white,
          so unlike my own,

          form adidas or from nike -


          your socks keep haunting me. 


          As I close my eyes, 
          focused entirely on remembering
          birth,

          in its own right, perhaps
          coming

          and passing out of existence,
          immense, age-old,
          an intensely felt moment



          it reminds me



          when I get lots in my own, 
          I hear your voice. 






          I'd write this line just as easily 
          as I'd slice a knife through the belly of a fish. 


          There are no politics here,
          is like saying,
          we are made out of nothing
          but dreams. 



          (How would me make out
          the lips?)



          What about the very real
          plumage, the soft,
          leathery - just like stroking a bird? 



          I long you into existence. 



          It feels so real to me, still. 


          Thank you for letting me
          run myself tired
          tracing your outline. 



          I roam the pavement sick tonight
          out of fear it is inadequate. 

          Just like trying to run 
          my yellow vans over milkstreet asphalt,

          I try to wrap this sentence around your waistline. 



          I'm wasting bow after precious bow
          of paper. 

          I heed it rather than the smooth remembering. 



          There is someone there who listens

          As we pass by,
          among us,

          the body of night - 


          and we shall meet on a bridge. 


          I notice you. 
          Just as you notice me in passing, distractedly
          typing a message into the void - 

          I remember. 



          Longing is the act of writing. 
          Time beautifies my doing so. 

          I steal glances at infinity
          as I grasp for specks of dust
          adrift throughout a cone of light. 

          Outside, somewhere
          the foggy body of night
          now lies low above the quiet. 


          There is someone there
          in what is being said. 


          There is a difference here,
          a difference between dreams and reality. 


          This
          is not
          reality. 

          This
          is a bridge. 



          But how wonderful!



          No more inhibition
          grasping the gear-stick, shifting.

          Laid-back in the front-seat, 
          I drive and I drive. 

          Here I do not have to guess at
          what has hurt you. 
          I can see your tears. 



          Corporeal, the politics of a hand-shake. 



          It is here
          what cannot be said,
          nor understood, nonetheless

          reaches out.

          And a question emerges
          like air:



          What can I say? 



          But in compassion with life's cruelties
          a burst of faith, 
          in the shape of 
          a coffee stain, 
          a penny
          lost at random, found
          by chance 
          on darknight streets. 



          The names of the stars
          are as pointless as labelling seconds. 



          Why would you feel the need
          to give a name to me? 



          You have poisoned this city
          with your cacophony of apparently names, 
          meaningless before

          rubber drawn like blood from a tree. 
          Merely for tires 
          and tissues and these leaves

          of paper. 



          My blistering skin
          once so peaceful 
          turned into dirt-red roads, before

          so different to any thing 



          You may shake my hand if you want to. 



          Opening a plane of thought, 
          a breath-taking void, 


          like yawning, 


          and sensational beasts
          of tenderness
          roaming throughout - 


          to end on a final note? 



          Orchestrated our reunions shall never be,

          infinite,
          luminous
          night


          finally to you
          my name becoming your lips in response


          night,
          luminous,
          infinite

          traffic, like the rush of the ocean
          ssssshen ssssshen ssssshen

          entering
          my room by the window, 
          a lullaby hummed

          throughout the veins of my body
          streets asleep of a city
          alight with cars!

          I really couldn't tell you what
          it is. 

          Believe me. 



          A beat given up, 
          the sad morning coming on. 

          A paradox? 
          Maybe. 

          But all it meant to me!

          To see a strand of your black hair
          whitening over time. 

          How sweet the rain used to be. 
          An image devastated
          by airraids.

          And yet I long for mandacaru

          sobre o sertão imaginado




          The city is opening its eyes
          as someone would open a faucet, 
          still
          alive. 

          I see my hair growing out again
          clogging the drain 
          of the shower. 

          And that is how I can meet you now,
          somewhere
          throughout these streets 
          folding in on themselves,

          shielding me from sunlight,

          dreaming of butts...



          as to what comes next?
          Cluelessness.

          A slight 
          anxiety before the hour of sleep,
          and me, a maldigested

          taste of moldy evenings. 


          Why write about it even? 
          Why try the impossible? 







          And suddenly,
          night is already there. 

          Preoccupied with life, 
          you did not know it 

          coming.

          I remember
          the moment: night replied

          to me after I had sent it
          letter after letter,
          of which but the last, the one
          reaching
          touched.

          But that was but
          an illusion. 

          We are certain, aren't we? 

          That such a thing, 
          as is night

          cannot be human, 
          cannot speak with us?

        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p class="text-paragraph">
          This body of writing, as it began, was a safeplace for my longing and
          my grief during a period of personal suffering. I feel, however, that
          since then, it has developed a life of its own. In earlier times,
          monks wrote on goat skins. But, since skins were rare and texts tended
          to differ in importance and legitimacy, they were often overwritten,
          one skin containing multiple layers of text. These skins, in
          historical terms, are called palimpsests. This body of writing is not
          a palimpsest in the strict sense, because the text itself, rather than
          its container, has been overwritten by me again and again, tranferring
          it from paper to my computer, writing with pen and keyboard, even
          recording it. Yet, the metaphor of skin fits the intimate quality of
          this poem. Also, it feels wrong for me to say: I wrote it. Since I
          mostly copied it. Nonetheless, I care for it deeply. I would ask you,
          therefore, you who are holding this body in your hands, to treat it no
          differently than you would treat your own body: tenderly, maybe in
          frustration sometimes, but most importantly, with compassion. ConradM.
