        <p class="verse">It is only in the park of this city,
          I will be able to meet you.

          Here it will be as if 
          we shook hands, actually
          touched.

          My body standing, erect
          your body before mine. 

          Our names written on each others' lips.



          Somewhere:



          The smile of a child,
          violently turned into blood
          by airraids.

          Not just an image removed,
          the body of night is devastated
          by searchlights.

          Even as each drop pummels
          the pavement, the rain
          and the -

          Go!

          Outside!

          And shake somebody's hand!
          Anybody's.





          I believe in the corporeal, so
          keep it up and the change!

          I have said this before:

          there
          is
          no
          right
          time.

          Water the plants in September since
          anybody might not be anybody at all!





          It is a sudden language,
          to be heard only when you speak it.
          
          Like cats playing
          on the brink of a rain
          drain - in the dead of night -

          waking you up. Then,
          a respite.

          As if storms were coming.



          I dream you up

          sitting by a brook somewhere, immediately
          flooded! and

                   and

          and Langston Hughes loves the rain!





          Leave me now.
          I have done all I could.

          There seems to be something,
          within each one of us, which
          must never be touched.

          I have done it.
          I have done
          all I could.

          And even though I have tried

          and

          tried, and even though
          we've met in my head so many times -
          it's always the same

          memory, afterwards.
          I could make up different ways
          for loving you.

          I could make up,
          make out,

          make - do anything!
          For loving you.

          Rays of sunlight, made up out of
          milky ways, travelling throughout yolksacks
          bursting the membrane,
          grasshoppers,
                       making their way across

          a greenleaf suspended in midair,
                                          laid
          low above the wind -
          with or without faces even!

          Or tracing our lips, that is
          by smiling,
          hanging upright in the air!

          Holding hands, barefooted, all ways,
          as long as we walk them together,

          I could make up
          for love of
          dreaming
          you I could
          be, and
          in the dark,
          between us

          there is something.





          It would all come back in an instant,
          I am sure of it:
          Asphalt and
          misty rain and
          chlor! something like washing powder and

          the smell!
          the smell!

          for the life of me I cannot remember
          the smell!

          I can remember a hectic
          bustling about and the sunshine, a heat -
          another lifetime...

          And so I keep on writing.
          I write against that which


          "cradled sprouts from the ground / made sunlight".




          Let us get up and greet the morning,
          all in blue,
          uniform -

          Can we trust its patrol?
          Even if we cannot understand each other?





          The night is coming on swiftly like your favorite song.
          Tenderly you know me, and
          of course I'm scared because of it!

          I gently rock you to sleep, your body
          pressed against mine.

          The dreams, the longing, the wishing, all
          this? Could this really be it?

          Following strange peoples,
          in strange suits,
          observing strange rituals,
          early in the morning.



          I can remember a bus-stop.



          I was sure, at that time,
          that nothing would ever defeat me.

          I felt
          confirmed
          in life's unharnished anxiety for -

          now

          I wonder...

          now

          I miss the rhythmic heat,
          my eyes are tired,

          now

          I wonder...

          What is essential?





          Sleep as an antidote against fleeting life.





          It felt like reaching
          attaining what I had desired.
          Experiencing in dumb incredulity
          the first breasts

          not being my mother's

          of a woman I loved -




          I remember.




          The question of day, evaded night -
          I have to face it instead:


          Which I once loved, where
          is that place now?


          A mouthcushion, the early morning

          sunlight lying scattered by the windowpane;
          not unlike a dry twig

          that breaks with a snap -


          Could I grasp it within my fingertips?



          Soft blue thoughts
          before these pastel walls,


          you eat me up as tenderly
          comes on the summer dawn, one
          dreaming, I

                   yawn

                         yawn

                               yawn


          Y       A        W         N


          A wide void throughout which
          these words keep chasing you.



          As the birds have,
          I sung your parting.

          You are long long gone.

          Stealing past my curtains,
          twilight
          is an opening like flesh.

          Where night's rough fingers touch
          day fades between your legs.

          Then you put them in my mouth,
          me, Suneater,
          full of greed

          like a puppy


                "blau"

                "blau"

                "blau"

          devouring every hour,
          a feast insatiable, until

          above the rooftops flicker
          discounted stars, and 
          the display flickers as the battery dies.





          The moon, an advertisement
          above the shopping mall,
          a hidden sequence:

          11110000000000000101110100001010101111110

          10000010101000000000000001010101000010101

          11100101010000001010111111111111101110101

          00000000000010111011111111111100010100010

          like an image digitalized:


          YOU ARE MY 1-AND-0-NLY !

          



          Bless me with a smile
          because I deserve it.

          You are just a memory to me now.
          A photo of a photo.


          And how many memories there are in the sky,
          "memories of a large memory".




          We are ellipsing each other.




          I'm not sure why.
          This dream I had had
          of the birds and the
          rain -


          The sound of my all my poetry this morning...


          The long wait unwound, and just
          as I was stretching out my arm -
          the alarm clock.

        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p class="text-paragraph">
          This body of writing, as it began, was a safeplace for my longing and
          my grief during a period of personal suffering. I feel, however, that
          since then, it has developed a life of its own. In earlier times,
          monks wrote on goat skins. But, since skins were rare and texts tended
          to differ in importance and legitimacy, they were often overwritten,
          one skin containing multiple layers of text. These skins, in
          historical terms, are called palimpsests. This body of writing is not
          a palimpsest in the strict sense, because the text itself, rather than
          its container, has been overwritten by me again and again, tranferring
          it from paper to my computer, writing with pen and keyboard, even
          recording it. Yet, the metaphor of skin fits the intimate quality of
          this poem. Also, it feels wrong for me to say: I wrote it. Since I
          mostly copied it. Nonetheless, I care for it deeply. I would ask you,
          therefore, you who are holding this body in your hands, to treat it no
          differently than you would treat your own body: tenderly, maybe in
          frustration sometimes, but most importantly, with compassion. ConradM.
