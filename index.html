          waking you up. Then,
          a respite.

          As if storms were coming.

          I have done all I could.

          There seems to be something,
          within each one of us, which
          must never be touched.

          I have done it.
          I have done
          all I could.

          And even though I have tried

          and

          tried, and even though
          we've met in my head so many times -

                       making their way across

          a greenleaf suspended in midair,
                                          laid
          low above the wind -

          Or tracing our lips, that is
          by smiling,
          hanging upright in the air!

          Holding hands, barefooted, all ways,
          as long as we walk them together,

          I could make up
          for love of
          dreaming
          you I could
          be, and
          in the dark,

          chlor! something like washing powder and

          the smell!
          the smell!

          for the life of me I cannot remember
          the smell!

          I can remember a hectic
          bustling about and the sunshine, a heat -
          another lifetime...

          And so I keep on writing.
          I write against that which

          I gently rock you to sleep, your body
          pressed against mine.

          The dreams, the longing, the wishing, all
          this? Could this really be it?

          Following strange peoples,
          in strange suits,
          observing strange rituals,

          early in the morning.

          now

          I miss the rhythmic heat,
          my eyes are tired,

          the first breasts

          not being my mother's

          sunlight lying scattered by the windowpane;

          Stealing past my curtains
          twilight is an opening like flesh.

          Where night's rough fingers touch
          day fades between your legs.

          Then you put them in my mouth,
          me, Suneater,
          full of greed
          singing a puppy's song:

          blau! blau! blau!

          The sound of my all my poetry in this morning...

          Its idea of caring for
          embracing everything at

          How you move through the streets.
          How you take up 
          space and claim power. 

          Just like

          because of this yellow cone of light
          on my nightstand
          dust becomes visible
          for a moment
          and
          a certain

          perimeter. 

          What might be said

          it then becomes ground.

           Memory, the blackened street -

          carries this plane behind glass 
          like a message in a bottle
          gleaming like seafoam -
          (or are we merely dreaming?):

          To hold me as you hold me near
          is only the thought of someone. 

          Instead wavelengths across space, and searching,
          I listen in:

          "...gleiche Weg ist nicht immer derselbe..."
          "...même si vous le parcouriez encors !"
          "...what's keeping me awake is what I lost..."

          Trusting our eyes!

          An empty space to be filled out?
          I am a pull and a traction - I am. 


          What is it to you? 


          The hair close to the drain
          whirling like clouds

          in the sky, and this wonder 
          at any scarlett

          Longing: it won't be quite the same, 
          regardless. The thin

          air, just before the rain 
          drops -
          made out of I guess

          it's been too long since I've seen a sunset.

          the deep

          why? 

          Every day is supposed to be a handful - 
          why? 



          How strange to trust my own voice
          again whispering anticipation, whispering. 

          Soft words inhaled on a melody. 
          I echo this song you sing. 

          What is life? 
          A condom ripping by chance.

          Instead,
          silence where once roaring currents
          led chanting blood through your veins, 

          before the rain
          pounded pools of pavement -

          Left onto an Ivory Kitchen Table!"



        !!! ALAS !!!



          I was careless. 
          And I wiped away without thinking. 

          Still sleepy 
          from a dream I had had
          of a the watercooker screeching screeching
          at 2AM in the morning.

          These thoughts, 
          allow me to journey them along your skin. 

          Since being means being 
          full of contradictions. 

          It is out of my hands now. 
          You are the traces I leave in the air. 

          To say we were made out of dreams,
          is to say anything, really - 



          Whose dreams? 



          Sunday mornings we revolve around breakfeast,
          coffee drunk without reserve. 

          The radio turned up
          to channel out your absence. 

          You can never straighten out
          paper folds. 

          You cannot throw this away
          without waste. 

          This city deserves a cure,
          a pen, a syringe:
          Tonight I feel like a virus, 
          a malignant body. 

          Greedily I inhabitate you
          being my host, strip you
          bare to grasp what lies beneath. 

          It's all just words, anyway. 

          Distractedly we even the interstices
          each morning by treading them with our feet. 

          What does that make me? 

          Hungry to feel a pulse
          I search the night

          But for the body of this city,
          nobody else is present. 
          I illuminate my own darkness. 
        </div>
        <div class="verse-divider"></div>

        <div class="verse-container">
          I do believe we meet here, you and me. 

          Between us, all these crumbled up 
          instances, not unlike folds in paper - 

          but sweet. 



          Should I, by chance,
          know the lines of you face, 
          that ironic miscalculation of fate,

          it shall be a brief communion;

          providing thought for a whole lifetime 
          cloaked in silence. 
        </div>
        <div class="verse-divider"></div>

        <div class="verse-container">
          I am since you touch me.
          Pulling my insides out and over 
          your feet, 

          writing about it now,
          because it excites me, 
          I think about sex. 

          I would wear them sometimes
          when we made love, 
          that intricate act of self-annihilation,
          plain, white,
          so unlike my own,

          form adidas or from nike -


          your socks keep haunting me. 


          As I close my eyes, 
          focused entirely on remembering
          birth,

          in its own right, perhaps
          coming

          and passing out of existence,
          immense, age-old,
          an intensely felt moment



          it reminds me



          when I get lots in my own,

        <div class="verse-container">
          I'd write this line just as easily

          There are no politics here,
          is like saying,
          we are made out of nothing
          but dreams. 



          (How would me make out
          the lips?)



          What about the very real
          plumage, the soft,
          leathery - just like stroking a bird? 



          I long you into existence. 



          It feels so real to me, still. 


          Thank you for letting me
          run myself tired
          tracing your outline.

          among us,

          the body of night - 


          and we shall meet on a bridge. 


          I notice you. 
          Just as you notice me in passing, distractedly
          typing a message into the void - 

          I remember. 
        </div>
        <div class="verse-divider"></div>

        <div class="verse-container">
          Longing is the act of writing. 
          Time beautifies my doing so. 

          I steal glances at infinity
          as I grasp for specks of dust
          adrift throughout a cone of light. 

          Outside, somewhere
          the foggy body of night
          now lies low above the quiet. 


          There is someone there
          in what is being said. 


          There is a difference here,
          a difference between dreams and reality. 


          This
          is not
          reality. 

          This
          is a bridge. 



          But how wonderful!



          No more inhibition
          grasping the gear-stick, shifting.

          Laid-back in the front-seat, 
          I drive and I drive. 

          Here I do not have to guess at
          what has hurt you. 
          I can see your tears. 



          Corporeal, the politics of a hand-shake.

          It is here
          what cannot be said,
          nor understood, nonetheless

          reaches out.

          And a question emerges
          like air:



          What can I say? 
        </div>
        <div class="verse-divider"></div>

        <div class="verse-container">
          But in compassion with life's cruelties
          a burst of faith, 
          in the shape of 
          a coffee stain, 
          a penny
          lost at random, found
          by chance 
          on darknight streets. 



          The names of the stars
          are as pointless as labelling seconds. 



          Why would you feel the need
          to give a name to me? 



          You have poisoned this city
          with your cacophony of apparently names, 
          meaningless before

          rubber drawn like blood from a tree. 
          Merely for tires 
          and tissues and these leaves

          of paper. 



          My blistering skin
          once so peaceful 
          turned into dirt-red roads, before

          so different to any thing

          and sensational beasts
          of tenderness
          roaming throughout - 


          to end on a final note?

          alight with cars!

          A beat given up,

          A paradox? 
          Maybe. 

          But all it meant to me!

          To see a strand of your black hair
          whitening over time. 

          How sweet the rain used to be. 
          An image devastated
          by airraids.

          clogging the drain 
          of the shower. 

          And that is how I can meet you now,
          somewhere
          throughout these streets 
          folding in on themselves,

          and me, a maldigested

          taste of moldy evenings.

          Preoccupied with life,

          coming.

          I remember
          the moment: night replied

          to me after I had sent it
          letter after letter,
          of which but the last, the one
          reaching
          touched.

          But that was but
          an illusion.

          cannot speak with us?

        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p class="text-paragraph">
          This body of writing, as it began, was a safeplace for my longing and
          my grief during a period of personal suffering. I feel, however, that
          since then, it has developed a life of its own. In earlier times,
          monks wrote on goat skins. But, since skins were rare and texts tended
          to differ in importance and legitimacy, they were often overwritten,
          one skin containing multiple layers of text. These skins, in
          historical terms, are called palimpsests. This body of writing is not
          a palimpsest in the strict sense, because the text itself, rather than
          its container, has been overwritten by me again and again, tranferring
          it from paper to my computer, writing with pen and keyboard, even
          recording it. Yet, the metaphor of skin fits the intimate quality of
          this poem. Also, it feels wrong for me to say: I wrote it. Since I
          mostly copied it. Nonetheless, I care for it deeply. I would ask you,
          therefore, you who are holding this body in your hands, to treat it no
          differently than you would treat your own body: tenderly, maybe in
          frustration sometimes, but most importantly, with compassion. ConradM.
